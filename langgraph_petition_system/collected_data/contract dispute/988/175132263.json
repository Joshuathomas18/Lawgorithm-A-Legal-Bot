The Chief Engineer or the Designated Officer is not an\nindependent authority or person, who has no connection or control over the work. As\na matter of fact, he is having over all supervision and charge of the execution of the\nwork. He is not required to hear the parties or to take evidence, oral or documentary.\nHe is not invested with the power to adjudicate upon the rights of the parties to the\ndispute or difference and his decision is subject to the right of the aggrieved party to\nseek relief in a Court of Law. The decision of the Chief Engineer or the Designated\nOfficer is treated as binding on the contractor subject to his right to avail remedy\nbefore an appropriate Court. The use of the expression „in the first place‟\nunmistakably shows that non-adjudicatory decision of the Chief Engineer is subject to\nthe right of the aggrieved party to seek remedy. Therefore, Clause 29 which is subject\nmatter of consideration in most of the appeals and similar clauses cannot be treated as\nan Arbitration Clause.&quot;\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                           Page 10 of 20</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"84190594\" id=\"span_11\">8.1.

The appellant herein was running an amusement park in\n       Pragati Maidan, New Delhi since the year 1984, which was well known as &quot;Appu\n       Ghar&quot;. The land for the purpose was initially allotted to the appellant by India\n       Trade Promotion Organisation (for short &#x27;the ITPO) on licence basis as the lease\n       between the Central Government and the ITPO was still pending and as such\n       permanent allotment of the land could not be made in favour of the appellant.\n       Only as an administrative measure, the license agreements were entered into\n       between the appellant and the ITPO. The appellant claimed that it was the\n       permanent allottee of the land for running the amusement park on the similar\n       lines as were allotted in favour of the Statutory Corporations/Instrumentalities of\n       the State and Central Government. It was only on the assurance of the Land &amp;\n       Development Office (for short &quot;the L&amp;DO&quot;), Ministry of Urban Development and\n       ITPO that the appellant made huge amount of investment for establishing and\n       running &quot;Appu Ghar&quot;. The last agreement entered into between the parties was\n       on 6.11.1995. In the said agreement, arbitration clauses 27 and 28 were\n       incorporated, which are extracted hereunder :-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">       &quot;27.

The relevant Clause reads as follows :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">      &quot;24. Dispute Redressal System\n      24.1 If any dispute or difference of any kind what-so-ever shall arises in\n      connection with or arising out of this Contract or the execution of Works or\n      maintenance of the Works there under, whether before its commencement\n      or during the progress of Works or after the termination, abandonment or\n      breach of the Contract, it shall, in the first instance, be referred for\n      settlement to the competent authority, described along with their powers in\n      the Contract Data, above the rank of the Engineer. The competent\n      authority shall, within a period of forty-five days after being requested in\n      writing by the Contractor to do so, convey his decision to the Contractor.\n      Such decision in respect of every matter so referred shall, subject to review\n      as hereinafter provided, be final and binding upon the Contractor. In case\n      the Works is already in progress, the Contractor shall proceed with the\n      execution of the Works, including maintenance thereof, pending receipt of\n      the decision of the competent authority as aforesaid, with all due diligence.\n      24.2 Either party will have the right of appeal, against the decision of the\n      competent authority, to the Standing Empowered Committee if the amount\n      appealed against exceeds rupees one lakh.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">      24.3 The composition of the Empowered Standing Committee will be:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">      I.

If he does not accept\n      the decision, he is not barred from approaching the courts. Similarly, if the\n      Employer does not accept the decision of the Standing Empowered\n      Committee above the limit of five percent of the Initial Contract Price, he\n      will be free to approach the courts applicable under the law.&quot;. We are of\n      the considered view that there are highly disputed questions of fact\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                        Page 13 of 20</span>\n\n\n\n\n       involved in this writ petition. These disputes cannot be decided in writ\n       proceedings. A writ Court normally does not enter into contractual matters.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">       It is not the job of the writ Court to assess what is the amount due and\n       payable. Only in rare cases where there is no dispute with regard to the\n       amount payable, the writ Court may issue a writ directing payment of the\n       amount. We are clearly of the view that in view of the absolutely\n       contradictory stands taken by both sides there is a dispute between them.\n       This dispute cannot be decided without recording the evidence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">       12. We, therefore, dismiss this writ petition with liberty reserved to the\n       petitioner to either take recourse to the dispute redressal mechanism\n       mentioned in Clause 24 of the agreement or to file a suit in the Court of\n       competent jurisdiction. We, however, make it clear that this dispute cannot\n       be decided in the writ proceedings. Therefore, the writ petition is dismissed\n       with the aforesaid directions. No order as to costs.&quot;\n\n\n\n9.1.              Mr. S.M. Chakraborty, learned Sr. counsel appearing\n\nfor the respondents-HSCL submits that the impugned letter dated\n\n25.04.2022 is not a letter of action but it is a letter of caution. So,\n\nthis cannot be a subject matter of challenge by filing a writ petition\n\nbefore this Hon&#x27;ble Court. As such the 1st writ petition i.e., WP(C)\n\nNo.454 of 2022 is a premature writ petition. 2ndly, the learned Sr.\n\ncounsel submits that if the petitioner feels aggrieved by the\n\nimpugned letter itself, the remedy lies in the agreement itself.\n\nClause 25 of the General Conditions of the Contract inter alia\n\nmandates that any dispute, arising out of the execution of the work\n\nwould not be subject to arbitration and that all such disputes would\n\nbe referred to the Dispute Redressal System, falling which, the\n\nparties to the contract would be free to seek redress from the\n\nHon&#x27;ble Court. Learned Sr. counsel submits that Clause 25 of the\n\nAgreement gives the steps when a person can go to Court. Further,\n\nlearned Sr. counsel also referred to Clause 24 i.e. the Dispute\n\nRedressal System of the contract. The petitioner has not exhausted\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                          Page 14 of 20</span>\n\n\n\n\nthe remedies of the contract agreement.

Chakraborty, learned Sr. counsel submits\n\nthat the Bank Guarantees were between the contractor and the\n\nBank and it was an unconditional guarantee, and that whenever the\n\nguarantee will be invoked the Bank has to abide. The argument of\n\nMr. Deb, learned Sr. counsel appearing for the petitioner that\n\nbefore the invocation of Bank Guarantees show cause notice has to\n\nbe issued is not a requirement of law. It can be invoked anytime\n\nand it is totally unconditional.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">                     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1342691\" id=\"span_17\">Accordingly,      to    support      the     above-mentioned\n\nargument on invocation of Bank Guarantees, learned Sr. counsel\n\ncited Para-26 of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court Judgment reported in\n\n(2006) 2 SCC 728 titled as <a href=\"/doc/1342691/\" id=\"a_13\">BSES Ltd.

Accordingly, we are prima facie not satisfied that\n       performance had been duly and satisfactorily certified. Under the terms of the\n       &quot;wrap-around agreement&quot;, the Appellant was entitled to encash all or any of the\n       bank guarantees for breach of the First Respondent&#x27;s obligations under any one\n       of the contracts. In our view, it is the case of the Appellant that there was no\n       satisfactory performance of the contract, as a result of which, the Appellant was\n       justified in encashing the concerned bank guarantee. Indeed, as per the terms of\n       the bank guarantee itself, the Appellant is the best judge to decide as to when\n       and for what reason the bank guarantees should be encashed. Further, it is no\n       function of the Second Respondent-Bank, nor of this Court, to enquire as to\n       whether due performance had actually happened when, under the terms of the\n       guarantee, the Second Respondent-Bank was obliged to make payment when the\n       guarantee was called in, irrespective of any contractual dispute between the\n       Appellant and the First Respondent. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"218672\" id=\"span_18\">Indeed, in similar circumstances, this Court\n       in <a href=\"/doc/218672/\" id=\"a_14\">General Electric Technical Services Company Inc. v.

The nature of the fraud that\n       the courts talk about is fraud of an &quot;egregious nature as to vitiate the entire\n       underlying transaction&quot;.

Mr. Chakraborty, learned Sr. counsel to further\n\nstrengthen his argument on the said argument, relied upon Paras-\n\n11 and 12 of Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court Judgment reported in (2008) 1\n\nSCC 544 titled as <a href=\"/doc/1028714/\" id=\"a_15\">Vinitec Electronics Private Ltd.

The law relating to invocation of bank guarantees is by\n       now well settled by a catena of decisions of this court. The bank guarantees\n       which provided that they are payable by the guarantor on demand is considered\n       to be an un- conditional bank guarantee. When in the course of commercial\n       dealings, unconditional guarantees have been given or accepted the beneficiary is\n       entitled to realize such a bank guarantee in terms thereof irrespective of any\n       pending disputes. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1746106\" id=\"span_21\">In <a href=\"/doc/1746106/\" id=\"a_16\">U.P. State Sugar Corporation vs. Sumac International Ltd.</a> ,\n       this court observed that :</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">       12. The law relating to invocation of such bank guarantees is by now well settled.\n       When in the course of commercial dealings an unconditional bank guarantee is\n       given or accepted, the beneficiary is entitled to realize such a bank guarantee in\n       terms thereof irrespective of any pending disputes. The bank giving such a\n       guarantee is bound to honour it as per its terms irrespective of any dispute raised\n       by its customer. The very purpose of giving such a bank guarantee would\n       otherwise be defeated. The courts should, therefore, be slow in granting an\n       injunction to restrain the realization of such a bank guarantee. The courts have\n       carved out only two exceptions. A fraud in connection with such a bank guarantee\n       would vitiate the very foundation of such a bank guarantee. Hence if there is\n       such a fraud of which the beneficiary seeks to take advantage, he can be\n       restrained from doing so. The second exception relates to cases where allowing\n       the encashment of an unconditional bank guarantee would result in irretrievable\n       harm or injustice to one of the parties concerned. Since in most cases payment of\n       money under such a bank guarantee would adversely affect the bank and its\n       customer at whose instance the guarantee is given, the harm or injustice\n       contemplated under this head must be of such an exceptional and irretrievable\n       nature as would over ride the terms of the guarantee and the adverse effect of\n       such an injunction on commercial dealings in the country. The two grounds are\n       not necessarily connected, though both may coexist in some cases.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">       12.          It is equally well settled in law that bank guarantee is an\n       independent contract between bank and the beneficiary thereof. The bank is\n       always obliged to honour its guarantee as long as it is an unconditional and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                          Page 16 of 20</span>\n\n\n\n\n      irrevocable one. The dispute between the beneficiary and the party at whose\n      instance the bank has given the guarantee is immaterial and of no\n      consequence. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1342691\" id=\"span_23\">In <a href=\"/doc/1342691/\" id=\"a_17\">BSES Limited (Now Reliance Energy Ltd.) vs. Fenner India Ltd.\n      And</a> anr. this court held :</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">      &quot; 10. There are, however, two exceptions to this Rule. The first is when there is a\n      clear fraud of which the Bank has notice and a fraud of the beneficiary from\n      which it seeks to benefit. The fraud must be of an egregious nature as to vitiate\n      the entire underlying transaction.

In terms of the argument of Mr. S.M.

Since the specific redressal is there in the above-\n\nmentioned contract and further the provision of appeal, receipt of\n\ndocuments, and appreciation of evidence are also indicated in the\n\ncontract, this Court finds that the petitioner ought to have\n\nexhausted the remedies given in the contract agreement. The\n\npetitioner was a signatory to the said agreement and he cannot\n\ndeviate and ignore the same unless his legitimate rights are\n\ninfringed upon which are guaranteed under the Constitution of\n\nIndia. Here it is not the case of that nature.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_60\">15.                It is seen from the record and revealed from the\n\narguments made by the learned counsel appearing for the parties\n\nthat there are disputed questions of facts regarding which date the\n\npetitioner was handed over the subject land for execution of the\n\nworks, on which date the petitioner has commenced the works, to\n\nwhat extent has petitioner commenced the work and completed the\n\nsame and to what extend the petitioner has attended the\n\nmaintenance works. None of the issues are found in the affidavit\n\nnor   in   the   correspondence          made      by    the   petitioner      to   the\n\nrespondents. It has not been specified in the affidavit nor is seen in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                 Page 19 of 20</span>\n\n\n\n\nthe records. The petitioner held the respondents accountable for\n\nlaches. It is also seen from the correspondence of the respondents\n\naddressed to the petitioner that the respondents held the petitioner\n\nfor not completing the works to their satisfaction but the details are\n\nundisclosed. In such a situation, where disputed question of facts\n\nare involved and certain crucial information is not provided by both\n\nparties, it is not possible to draw a conclusion on either side. On\n\none hand, the petitioner submits that he has completed the works\n\nand there was no proper appreciation and cooperation in terms of\n\nthe agreement by the respondents, vice versa the respondents\n\ncontended that the petitioner has not completed the works in terms\n\nof the agreement. So, this disputed question of facts cannot be\n\ngone into in a writ petitioner filed under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 226</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_61\">16.            In terms of the above facts and on perusal of the\n\nJudgment as referred by Mr. Somik Deb, learned Sr. counsel\n\nappearing for the petitioner, in support of his arguments, this Court\n\nfinds that the same are not relevant to the facts of the case.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_62\">17.            Further, the 1st writ petition i.e. WP(C) No.454 of\n\n2022 is premature since the impugned letter dated 24.04.2022 is\n\nonly a letter of caution and not a letter of action. So, this cannot be\n\na subject matter of challenge by filing a writ petition before this\n\nCourt\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                              Page 20 of 20</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_63\">           18.                 The 2nd writ petition i.e. WP(C) No.1033 of 2022\n\n           relates to the impugned letter dated 19.11.2022 addressed by\n\n           respondents-HSCL to the Chief Manager, Union Bank of India\n\n           seeking to release the Bank Guarantees. The present writ petition\n\n           is filed on 28.11.2022. During the course of the argument, it is\n\n           informed    that     in   pursuance   of   the    demand   made   by   the\n\n           respondent-HSCL, vide impugned letter dated 19.11.2022, the\n\n           respondent-Bank immediately released the Bank guarantee in\n\n           favour of the respondents-HSCL. As such nothing survives for\n\n           granting any reliefs to the petitioner and this present WP(C)\n\n           No.1033 of 2022 also becomes infructuous.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_64\">           19.
