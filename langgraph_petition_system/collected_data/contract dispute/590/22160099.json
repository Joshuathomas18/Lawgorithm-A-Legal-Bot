Let us consider what a civil court would have\n             done in a case where the defendant puts forth the\n             defence of accord and satisfaction on the basis of a full\n             and final discharge voucher issued by plaintiff, and the\n             plaintiff     alleges    that      it   was   obtained       by\n             fraud/coercion/undue influence and therefore not valid. It\n             would consider the evidence as to whether there was any\n             fraud, coercion or undue influence. If it found that there\n             was none, it will accept the voucher as being in discharge of\n             the contract and reject the claim without examining the\n             claim on merits. On the other hand, if it found that the\n             discharge voucher had been obtained by fraud/undue\n             influence/coercion, it will ignore the same, examine\n             whether plaintiff had made out the claim on merits and\n             decide the matter accordingly. The position will be the same\n             even when there is a provision for arbitration. The Chief\n             Justice/his designate exercising jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_6\">section\n             11</a> of the Act will consider whether there was really accord\n             and satisfaction or discharge of contract by performance. If\n             the answer is in the affirmative, he will refuse to refer the\n             dispute to arbitration. On the other hand, if the Chief\n             Justice/his designate comes to the conclusion that the full\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                     Page 11 of 42</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                                           Downloaded on : Sat Feb 01 02:47:31 IST 2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">           C/IAAP/43/2019                                            ORDER</span>\n\n\n\n\n              and final settlement receipt or discharge voucher was the\n              result of any fraud/coercion/undue influence, he will have\n              to hold that there was no discharge of the contract and\n              consequently refer the dispute to arbitration. Alternatively,\n              where the Chief Justice/his designate is satisfied prima facie\n              that the discharge voucher was not issued voluntarily and\n              the claimant was under some compulsion or coercion, and\n              that the matter deserved detailed consideration, he may\n              instead of deciding the issue himself, refer the matter to the\n              arbitral tribunal with a specific direction that the said\n              question should be decided in the first instance. &quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"51095127\" id=\"span_37\">2.

Bank Ltd., addressed a\n  letter to the respondent with instructions to remit the\n  proceeds of the applicant&#x27;s claim under the SFSP policy to\n  the Applicant&#x27;s loan account in SPCB. This instruction was\n  issued because of the assignment of the SFSP policy to\n  SPCB for the various credit facilities enjoyed by the\n  applicant.        Therefore, the Agreed Bank Clause was\n  specifically incorporated in the SFSP Policy, which entitles\n  SPCB to accept the settlement amount and issue a\n  discharge voucher to the Respondent.          It is further\n  submitted that as per the Agreed Bank Clause, receipt of\n  SPCB shall be complete discharge of the Respondent and\n  shall be binding on all parties insured under the SFSP\n  Policy.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_49\">  11.

They further instructed the Respondent to remit\n  the proceeds of the claim as per their remittance\n  instructions.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">  12.

I say that on 7th June 2018, the Applicant issued\n  an arbitration notice in respect of its claim under the SFSP\n  Policy to the respondent. The Respondent relied on 18th\n  August 2018 and refused arbitration, as no grounds\n  existed for referring the alleged dispute to arbitration.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_54\">  16.

I submit that the position of law on interpretation\n  of insurance policies is settled. The terms and conditions\n  of a policy have to be interpreted strictly and have to be\n  read as they are expressed. There can be no departure from\n  the terms and conditions of the policy on the grounds of\n  equity and it is not open to the Court to add / subtract /\n  amend words of the policy or indeed substitute its own\n  judgment for the express language stipulated in the policy\n  to create what may appear to be more reasonable result. It\n  is a matter of record that the SFSP Policy has an Agreed\n  Bank Clause endorsed and forming part of the SFSP Policy\n  issued by the Respondent.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">  18.       I state that a bare reading of the Agreed Bank\n  Clause would indicate that once the Bank has given a valid\n  receipt in respect of the monies received towards the\n  Applicant&#x27;s claim under the SFSP Policy, it would amount\n  to a complete discharge of the obligations of the\n  Respondent. Such discharge shall be binding on all parties\n  insured under the SFSP Policy, being the Applicant. I state\n  that the receipt of SPCB and the acknowledgment of\n  payment is contained in the discharge voucher dated 14\n  August 2017 (Annexure E), which SPCB has executed.\n  This amounts to a complete discharge of the obligations of\n  the Respondent in light of the full and final settlement\n  offered by it and accepted by SPCB. The discharge voucher\n  dated 10 August 2017 (Annexure C) relied upon by the\n  Applicant is invalid as under the Agreed Bank Clause, it\n  was SPCB that was to acknowledge receipt of monies and\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">                         Page 18 of 42</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">                                               Downloaded on : Sat Feb 01 02:47:31 IST 2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\"> C/IAAP/43/2019                                        ORDER</span>\n\n\n\n  discharge the Respondent upon full and final satisfaction\n  of the claim under the SFSP Policy.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">  19.       I say that SPCB was the lead financier to the\n  Applicant and by operation of the Agreed Bank Clause, the\n  monies payable under the SFSP Policy were paid by the\n  Respondent to the Applicant&#x27;s loan account in SPCB in\n  compliance with sub­clause (a) of the said Agreed Bank\n  Clause and upon specific instructions of SPCB.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_59\">  20.       I say that, in the circumstances, if the discharge\n  voucher dated 14 august 2017 is to be assailed and\n  challenged on any grounds, then it would have to be SPCB\n  to make the assertion that it acted under duress when\n  accepting and / or executing the said discharge voucher. It\n  is clear from the record that not a single document or\n  writing has been produced, which demonstrate such\n  assertions by SPCB.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_60\">  21.       I say that the Applicant, in light of the foregoing\n  circumstances, as well as the Agreed Bank Clause, is bound\n  by the discharge voucher dated 14th August 2017 and does\n  not even have the locus to challenge or assail its binding\n  effect or legality and invoke the arbitration to raise\n  disputes concerning the alleged balance amounts.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_61\">  22.       I say that in any event, it is established that the\n  only entity which could even make allegations that its\n  consent was obtained under duress SPCB, given the monies\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">                         Page 19 of 42</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">                                               Downloaded on : Sat Feb 01 02:47:31 IST 2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\"> C/IAAP/43/2019                                       ORDER</span>\n\n\n\n\n  were paid to it by the respondent and there is no document\n  or writing before this Hon&#x27;ble Court from SPCB in these\n  proceedings. On this basis, the discharge voucher dated\n  14th August 2017 continues to be binding and accordingly\n  there cannot be any dispute, which can be arbitrated in the\n  present instance.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_62\">  23.       Furthermore, I say that the purported protest\n  lodged by the Applicant is belated and an afterthought.\n  The applicant by way of its letter dated 4th September\n  2017 lodged its purported protest against the claim\n  settlement by the respondent. It is a settled position of law\n  that such a protest after the expiry of 3 weeks is not a\n  valid protest. The applicant was under an obligation to\n  protest to the settlement immediately and promptly.              I\n  submit that such a belated protest is indicative of the fact\n  that the applicant is attempting to extract monies from the\n  respondent, which are not contractually due and an effort\n  to a windfall gain over and above the lawful contractual\n  settlement by the respondent.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_63\">  24.       I also submit that the fraud/coercion/duress\n  alleged in respect of submission of consent to the building\n  claim is without any material particulars, amounting to\n  mere bald assertions, conjectures and surmises. Therefore,\n  the applicant cannot assail the full and final settlement,\n  especially when there was a belated protest.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">  25.

Without prejudice to the foregoing, I submit that\n  there is no fraud/coercion/duress in the applicant\n  accepting the settlement offered by the respondent.

Moreover, I submit that it is now a settled position\n  that the appointment of an arbitrator is a judicial power\n  and not a mere administrative function leaving some\n  degree of judicial intervention, when it comes to the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">                         Page 21 of 42</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">                                                 Downloaded on : Sat Feb 01 02:47:31 IST 2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">           C/IAAP/43/2019                                        ORDER</span>\n\n\n\n\n            question to examine the existence of a prima facie\n            arbitration agreement.      Furthermore, it is necessary to\n            ensure that the dispute resolution process does not become\n            unnecessarily protracted.      As such, the Court exercising\n            jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_11\">section 11</a> of the Act, cannot adopt a\n            mechanical approach in appointing an arbitrator without\n            any supportive evidence in record to prima facie\n            substantiate that an arbitrable dispute subsisted under the\n            agreement, which needs to be referred to an arbitrator/s\n            for adjudication.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_68\">            29.

It\nwas further contended on behalf of respondent that for reference stated\nin para­10 to 26 of the reply, there is arbitral dispute exists.

Obviously, the\n            discharge voucher cannot be considered to be\n            voluntary or as having resulted in discharge of\n            the contract by accord and satisfaction.

Suffice it to say that appointment of an arbitrator\n   is a judicial power and is not a mere administrative\n   function leaving some degree of judicial intervention\n   when it comes to the question to examine the existence\n   of a prima facie arbitration agreement, it is always\n   necessary to ensure that the dispute resolution process\n   does not become unnecessarily protracted.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_87\">   21. In the instant case, prima facie no dispute\n   subsisted after the discharge voucher being signed by\n   the respondent without any demur or protest and\n   claim being finally settled with accord and satisfaction\n   and after 11 weeks of the settlement of claim a letter\n   was sent on 27th July, 2016 for the first time raising a\n   voice in the form of protest that the discharge voucher\n   was signed under undue influence and coercion with\n   no supportive prima facie evidence being placed on\n   record in absence thereof, it must follow that the claim\n   had been settled with accord and satisfaction leaving\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">                       Page 30 of 42</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">                                             Downloaded on : Sat Feb 01 02:47:31 IST 2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_108\">           C/IAAP/43/2019                                     ORDER</span>\n\n\n\n             no arbitral dispute subsisting under the agreement to\n             be referred to the Arbitrator for adjudication.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_88\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"176130133\" id=\"span_109\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"19604233\" id=\"span_110\">17.   The Court has heard learned counsels for the parties. The\npetitioner&#x27;s counsel has heavily relied upon the Arbitration Clause and\ndecisions of the Supreme Court cited hereinabove to support his\ncontention that there exists a valid Arbitration clause and so called\ndischarge voucher submitted by the Banker cannot preclude the\npetitioner from seeking reference of the dispute to the Arbitrator under\nthe provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_28\">Arbitration Act</a>. The decision cited at bar on behalf\nof petitioner would clearly indicate that discharge voucher unless it is\nproved to be without coercion, would not preclude the Court from\nreferring the matter to Arbitrator. The Delhi High Court decision\nreferring to ERDA circular dated 28.9.2015 which has been heavily\nrelied upon by counsel for the petitioner, the said circular is attempted\nto be explained by counsel for respondent that same is only for the\npurpose of indicating that discharge voucher may not be obtained\nforcefully or there should not be any element of coercion while\ndischarging voucher, the same could not therefore be avail to the\npetitioner, as submitted by counsel for petitioner. The counsel for\nrespondent contended that &#x27;agreed bank clause&#x27; stated hereinabove\nwould clearly indicate that the discharge voucher issued by the Bank\nwas valid and appropriately binding to the parties including the\npetitioner and therefore, same is required to be considered and petition\nis required to be dismissed as no Arbitrator need to be appointed. The\ncounsel for respondent placed heavy reliance upon the decision of <a href=\"/doc/19604233/\" id=\"a_29\">New\nIndia Assurance Company Limited</a> (supra) and subsequent decision in\ncase of <a href=\"/doc/176130133/\" id=\"a_30\">United India Insurance Company Limited Vs.

When the contractee accepted\n            the final payment in full and final\n            satisfaction of all its claims, there is no\n            point in raising the claim for losses\n            incurred during the execution of the\n            contract at a belated stage which creates\n            an iota of doubt as to why such claim was\n            not settled at the time of submitting final\n            bills that too in the absence of exercising\n            duress or coercion on the contractee by the\n            appellant contractor. In our considered\n            view, the plea raised by the contractee\n            company is bereft of any details and\n            particulars, and cannot be anything but a\n            bald assertion.

A reading of the Law Commission\n   Report, together with the Statement of Objects and\n   Reasons, shows that the Law Commission felt that\n   the judgments in SBP &amp; Co. (supra) and <a href=\"/doc/1243245/\" id=\"a_59\">Boghara\n   Polyfab</a> (supra) required a relook, as a result of\n   which, so far as <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 11</a> is concerned, the\n   Supreme Court or, as the case may be, the High\n   Court, while considering any application under\n   <a href=\"/doc/1067630/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 11(4)</a> to <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_62\">11(6)</a> is to confine itself to the\n   examination of the existence of an arbitration\n   agreement and leave all other preliminary issues to\n   be decided by the arbitrator.&quot;</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_104\">   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1243245\" id=\"span_146\">10.      This being the position, it is clear that the\n   law prior to the 2015 Amendment that has been\n   <a href=\"/doc/1243245/\" id=\"a_63\">laid down by</a> this Court, which would have included\n   going into whether accord and satisfaction has\n   taken place, has now been legislatively overruled.</span>\n   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"133653680\" id=\"span_147\">This being the position, it is difficult to agree with\n   the reasoning contained in the aforesaid judgment\n   as <a href=\"/doc/63461877/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 11(6A)</a> is confined to the examination of\n   the existence of an arbitration agreement and is to\n   be understood in the narrow sense as has been <a href=\"/doc/1243245/\" id=\"a_65\">laid\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_148\">                            Page 40 of 42</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_149\">                                               Downloaded on : Sat Feb 01 02:47:31 IST 2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_150\">           C/IAAP/43/2019                                       ORDER</span>\n\n\n\n             down in</a> the judgment <a href=\"/doc/133653680/\" id=\"a_66\">Duro Felguera, S.A.</a> (supra) ­\n             see paras 48 &amp; 59.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_105\">             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"51095127\" id=\"span_151\">11.      We, therefore, overrule the judgment in\n             <a href=\"/doc/51095127/\" id=\"a_67\">United India Insurance Company Limited</a> (supra)\n             as not having laid down the correct law but dismiss\n             this appeal for the reason given in para 3 above.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_106\">             12.      Mr. Rohatgi now requests us for an extension\n             of the status quo order granted by the trial court for\n             a period of one week from today so that he may\n             adopt other proceedings. This request is granted.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_107\">20.   in light of this discussion, it can well be said that this Court\nwithout going into detail the rival contentions qua the effect of discharge\nissued by the Bank, agreed bank clause and other issues, refer the matter\nto the Arbitrator, who will have a jurisdiction to examine all the issue in\ndetail under <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 16</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_108\">21.   In view of the aforesaid discussion, it can well be said that there\nremains hardly any scope for this Court under Section­11 of the\n<a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_69\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</a> for embarking upon any detailed\nprobe or investigation and examination of any other issues especially\nwhen there is a clear and indisputable existence of arbitration clause in\nthe agreement. This Court is therefore, of the considered view that the\nparties may take­up all the available contentions before the arbitrator, as\nSection­16 of the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_70\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</a> provides ample\nopportunity and scope. Therefore, at this stage, suffice it to say that the\nCourt is of the view that the dispute in question does merit reference to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_152\">                                  Page 41 of 42</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_153\">                                                        Downloaded on : Sat Feb 01 02:47:31 IST 2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_154\">                  C/IAAP/43/2019                              ORDER</span>\n\n\n\nthe arbitrator for adjudication under the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_71\">Arbitration and Conciliation\nAct, 1996</a> leaving complete liberty to the parties to take­up all the issues\nincluding the discharge by the bank and its efficacy or otherwise and this\nCourt&#x27;s observations being prima facie shall not impede any party to\nmake good the admissible contentions under the law before the\narbitrators. The parties have to be given an opportunity to arrive at a\nconsensual name for referring the dispute and therefore, this Court is\nproposing to adjourn this matter so that in the meantime the parties may\narrive at a mutually agreed name and the arbitrator could be appointed\nfor undertaking the arbitration in respect of the dispute failing which the\nCourt would appoint arbitrator for adjudication of dispute.
