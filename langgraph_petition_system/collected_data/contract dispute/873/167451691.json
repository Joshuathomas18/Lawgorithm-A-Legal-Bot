The nature of the work is defined as &quot;Setting up of\n\nGeneral Degree college at L.T.Vally Chailengta, Tripura, Dhalai\n\nUnder ACA/Construction of Academic building (Ground Floor only),\n\nAdministrative Building (Ground Floor Only), Type-III Qtr.

For execution of the works, as referred to in details in\n\nthe Arbitration Petitions (Petitions for short), the Executive\n\nEngineer, Longthorai Valley Division issued respective Work\n\nOrders, in favour of the claimant-petitioner (petitioner for short),\n\npursuant whereto, respective Agreements were entered into, by\n\nand between the parties.\n\n\n5.              For resolving the disputes, the petitioner had submitted\n\nLetters    to    the    Executive       Engineer,       each     dated      19.12.2017\n\n(Annexure-1 at Pages- 11 to 13 of the respective paper books).\n\nSince, the said Prayers of the petitioner did not fetch any result,\n\nthe petitioner had presented two respective Petitions, under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_13\">Section    11(6)</a>        read   with     <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_14\">Section        12</a>   of   the    Arbitration    &amp;\n\nConciliation Act, 1996 <a href=\"/doc/54424454/\" id=\"a_15\">(AC Act</a> for short), before this Hon&#x27;ble High\n\nCourt, for appointment of an Arbitrator, and by a common Order\n\ndated     28.11.2018       (Annexure-2           at    Pages-14        to   15   of   the\n                                Page - 5 of 20\n\nrespective paper books), the petitioner was permitted to withdraw\n\nthe said two Petitions, enabling him to exhaust the in-house\n\nremedy, as provided under Clause 22 of the Agreement.\n\n\n6.          Thereafter, inter alia urging for resolving the disputes,\n\nthe petitioner had submitted Letters to the Superintending\n\nEngineer, each dated 04.12.2018 (Annexure-3 at Pages-16 to 21\n\nof the respective paper books).\n\n\n7.          By a Communication dated 05.01.2019 (Annexure-4 at\n\nPage-22 of the respective paper books), the Superintending\n\nEngineer repulsed the claims of the petitioner.\n\n\n8.          Thereafter, the petitioner did not approach the Chief\n\nEngineer,   and   on      03.05.2019,    straightaway   presented    the\n\nconnected petitions, marked as Arb. P. Nos. 15 &amp; 16 of 2019, for\n\nappointment of an Arbitrator, for resolving the disputes, as raised\n\nby him.\n\n\n9.          After presentation of the said Petitions, Notices were\n\nissued upon the respondents, and initially, in the Counter\n\nAffidavit, a plea was taken that since, the petitioner did not\n\napproach the Chief Engineer, for appointment of an arbitrator, the\n\nsaid petitions of the petitioner, seeking appointment of arbitrator,\n\nis not maintainable.\n\n\n10.         Thereafter,      the     respondents    have     filed    a\n\nSupplementary Affidavit, whereby in addition to the above\n\nreferred previous plea, the respondents have raised a further plea\n\n(Paragraph 3(b) at Page-52 of the respective paper books) that\n\nafter efflux of 15 days, from the date of the decision of the\n\nSuperintending Engineer dated 05.01.2019 (Annexure-4 at Page-\n                                Page - 6 of 20\n\n22 of the respective paper books), the said decision has become\n\nfinal and binding, and there is no scope for continuation of the\n\ndisputes, nor any claim for arbitration can be sustained.\n\n\n11.        In   re:   Issue     No.1:-     In   view    of   the    statutory\n\nmandates, contained in <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 11(6)</a> read with Explanations 1 &amp;\n\n2 of <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 12(1)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/16912364/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 12(5)</a> read with the Sixth &amp;\n\nSeventh Schedule, as inserted by the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_19\">Arbitration &amp; Conciliation\n\n(Amendment) Act</a>, as promulgated with effect from 23.10.2015,\n\nwhether the petitioner could have submitted an Application to the\n\nChief Engineer, for appointment/nomination of an Arbitrator?\n\n\n12.        In view of the statutory mandates, contained in <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_20\">Section\n\n11(6)</a> read with Explanations 1 &amp; 2 of <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 12(1)</a>, read with\n\n<a href=\"/doc/16912364/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 12(5)</a>, read with the Sixth &amp; Seventh Schedule, as\n\ninserted, by the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_23\">Arbitration &amp; Conciliation (Amendment) Act</a>, with\n\neffect from 23.10.2015, the Chief Engineer has become statutorily\n\ndisqualified to act as an Arbitrator, and therefore, he has also\n\nbecome statutorily disqualified to appoint/nominate an Arbitrator\n\nfor resolving the disputes. In view of the following judicial\n\npronouncements, the said Issue is no longer res integra. In Jivraj\n\nVrs. Hashwani, ; MANU/UKSC/0041/2011 : (2011) 1 WLR\n\n1872, the United Kingdom Supreme Court in paragraphs 44 &amp; 45\n\nobserved as under:\n\n           &quot;44 .   In this regard an arbitrator is in a very\n           different position from a judge. The precise status of\n           a judge was left open by this court in O&#x27;Brien\n           MANU/UKSC/0068/2010 : [2010] 4 All ER 62, in\n           which the court referred particular questions to the\n           Court of Justice: see para 41. However, as Sir Robert\n           Carswell said in Perceval-Price [2000] IRLR 380 and\n           Lord Walker said in O&#x27;Brien (at para 27), judges,\n           including both recorders and all judges at every level\n                                  Page - 7 of 20\n\n           are subject to terms of service of various kinds. As\n           Sir Robert put it, although judges must enjoy\n           independence of decision without direction from any\n           source, they are in other respects not free agents to\n           work as and when they choose, as are self-employed\n           persons.\n\n           45.     In both those cases the court was considering\n           the relationship between the relevant department of\n           state    and   the   judges   concerned.      It   was   not\n           considering the relationship between the judges and\n           the litigants who appear before them. Here, by\n           contrast, the court is considering the relationship\n           between the parties to the arbitration on the one\n           hand and the arbitrator or arbitrators on the other.\n           As I see it, there is no basis upon which it could\n           properly be held that the arbitrators agreed to work\n           under the direction of the parties as contemplated in\n           para 67 of Allonby [2004] ICR 1328. Further, in so\n           far as dominant purpose is relevant, I would hold\n           that     the   dominant   purpose      of   appointing   an\n           arbitrator or arbitrators is the impartial resolution of\n           the dispute between the parties in accordance with\n           the terms of the agreement and, although the\n           contract between the parties and the arbitrators\n           would be a contract for the provision of personal\n           services, they were not personal services under the\n           direction of the parties.&quot;\n\n\n           The aforesaid principle stands acknowledged, accepted\n\nand applied by the Constitution Courts in India as it is noticed\n\nhereinafter.\n\n\n13.        In HRD Corporation (Marcus Oil and Chemical\n\nDivision) Vrs. Gail (India) Limited (Formerly Gas Authority\n\nof India):(2018) 12 SCC 471 where in para-12 the Apex Court\n\nfurther held:\n\n           &quot;12. After the 2016 Amendment Act, a dichotomy is\n           made by the Act between persons who become\n                                     Page - 8 of 20\n\n          &quot;ineligible&quot; to be appointed as arbitrators, and\n          persons about whom justifiable doubts exist as to\n          their independence or impartiality. Since ineligibility\n          goes   to   the      root   of     the   appointment, <a href=\"/doc/16912364/\" id=\"a_24\">Section\n          12(5)</a> read with the Seventh Schedule makes it clear\n          that if the arbitrator falls in any one of the categories\n          specified in the Seventh Schedule, he becomes\n          &quot;ineligible&quot; to act as arbitrator. Once he becomes\n          ineligible, it is clear that, under <a href=\"/doc/966297/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 14(1)(a)</a>, he\n          then   becomes       de     jure      unable   to   perform   his\n          functions inasmuch as, in law, he is regarded as\n          &quot;ineligible&quot;.   In   order       to   determine     whether   an\n          arbitrator is de jure unable to perform his functions,\n          it is not necessary to go to the Arbitral Tribunal\n          under <a href=\"/doc/1137274/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 13</a>. Since such a person would lack\n          inherent jurisdiction to proceed any further, an\n          application may be filed under <a href=\"/doc/409037/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 14(2)</a> to the\n          Court to decide on the termination of his/her\n          mandate on this ground.&quot;\n\n\n14.       Prior thereto the Apex Court in TRF Limited Vrs.\n\nEnergo Engineering Projects limited: (2017) 8 SCC 377 in\n\nparagraphs 53 and 54 observed as under;\n\n\n          &quot;53. The aforesaid authorities have been commended\n          to us to establish the proposition that if the\n          nomination of an arbitrator by an ineligible arbitrator\n          is allowed, it would tantamount to carrying on the\n          proceeding of arbitration by himself. According to the\n          learned counsel for the appellant, ineligibility strikes\n          at the root of his power to arbitrate or get it\n          arbitrated upon by a nominee.\n\n\n          54. In such a context, the fulcrum of the controversy\n\n          would be, can an ineligible arbitrator, like the\n\n          Managing Director, nominate an arbitrator, who may\n\n          be otherwise eligible and a respectable person. As\n\n          stated earlier, we are neither concerned with the\n\n          objectivity nor the individual respectability. We are\n\n          only concerned with the authority or the power of the\n                                Page - 9 of 20\n\n           Managing Director. By our analysis, we are obligated\n\n           to arrive at the conclusion that once the arbitrator\n\n           has become ineligible by operation of law, he cannot\n\n           nominate another as an arbitrator. The arbitrator\n\n           becomes ineligible as per prescription contained\n\n           in <a href=\"/doc/16912364/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 12(5)</a> of the Act. It is inconceivable in law\n\n           that person who is statutorily ineligible can nominate\n\n           a person. Needless to say, once the infrastructure\n\n           collapses, the superstructure is bound to collapse.\n\n           One cannot have a building without the plinth. Or to\n\n           put it differently, once the identity of the Managing\n\n           Director as the sole arbitrator is lost, the power to\n\n           nominate    someone      else   as   an   arbitrator   is\n\n           obliterated. Therefore, the view expressed by the\n\n           High Court is not sustainable and we say so.&quot;\n\n\n15.        The view taken by the R. F. Nariman(J) in HRD\n\nCorporation (Marcus Oil and Chemical Division)(supra)\n\nstands reiterated in Bharat Broadband Network Ltd. Vrs.\n\nUnited Telecom Ltd.:(2019) 1 TLR (SC) 73.\n\n\n16.        Also this Court has already expressed its view, on\n\nsimilar lines, in Ashes Deb Vrs. State of Tripura:(2019) 1 TLR\n\n267.\n\n\n17.        Thus, neither the petitioner could have submitted an\n\nApplication,   to     the   Chief     Engineer,      requesting        him,   to\n\nappoint/nominate an Arbitrator, for resolving the disputes, nor the\n\nChief Engineer could have appointed/ nominated an Arbitrator. In\n\nsuch view of the matter, contention of the respondents that for\n\nnot making a Prayer to the Chief Engineer, to appoint/nominate\n\nan Arbitrator, and as such, the Petitions presented by the\n                             Page - 10 of 20\n\npetitioner, are liable to be dismissed, is wholly untenable, and\n\nhence, the same merits outright rejection.\n\n\n18.        In re: Issue No.2:- In view of the statutory mandate,\n\ncontained in <a href=\"/doc/54424454/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 43</a> of the AC Act, whether the period of\n\nlimitation of 3 years, as prescribed, under <a href=\"/doc/249731/\" id=\"a_30\">Article 137</a> of Part II of\n\nthe Schedule, appended to the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_31\">Limitation Act, 1963</a>, can be\n\nsuperseded, by taking recourse to any Clause of an Agreement?\n\n\n19.        <a href=\"/doc/54424454/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 43(1)</a> of the AC Act expressly mandates that\n\nthe prescriptions, contained in the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_33\">Limitation Act</a> would apply to\n\narbitration as it applies to proceedings in the Court. <a href=\"/doc/54424454/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 43(2)</a>\n\nof the AC Act mandates that for the purposes of the said Section\n\nand the Limitation Act, a legal fiction has been created, by\n\nmandating that Arbitration would commence on the date, as\n\nreferred to in <a href=\"/doc/29095305/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 21</a> of the AC Act.\n\n\n20.        That both <a href=\"/doc/138599/\" id=\"a_36\">Sections 21</a> &amp; <a href=\"/doc/1724405/\" id=\"a_37\">43</a> fall under Part-I i.e.,\n\nArbitration. Since, <a href=\"/doc/54424454/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 43(2)</a> of the AC Act correspondingly\n\nrefers to <a href=\"/doc/29095305/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 21</a>, it would be profitable to refer herein to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/29095305/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 21</a> of the AC Act which mandates that unless otherwise\n\nagreed upon by the parties, an Arbitral Proceeding in respect of a\n\ndispute, commences on the date on which a request for that\n\ndispute for referring to arbitration, has been received by the\n\nrespondent.\n\n           Admittedly, in the instant case, nothing otherwise was\n\nagreed upon by the parties, and therefore, <a href=\"/doc/29095305/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 21</a> of the AC\n\nAct would have its full play. As stated supra, vide the Letter dated\n\n19.12.2017 (Annexure-1 at Pages-11 to 13 of the respective\n\npaper books), the petitioner had raised his dispute, which was\n\nreceived by the respondent on 20.12.2017. Applying the mandate,\n                                  Page - 11 of 20\n\ncontained in <a href=\"/doc/29095305/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 21</a> of the AC Act, it emerges therefrom that\n\nthe proceedings had commenced on 20.12.2017.\n\n\n21.        A quick reference may be made to <a href=\"/doc/249731/\" id=\"a_43\">Article 137</a> of Part\n\nII of the Schedule, appended to the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_44\">Limitation Act, 1963</a>, which\n\nreads thus:-\n\n          Article   Description of Suit                  Period       of   Time       from\n                                                         limitation        which     period\n                                                                           begins to run\n          137.      Any other application for which no   Three             When        the\n                    period of limitation is provided     years             aright to apply\n                    elsewhere in this Division.                            accrues\n\n\n\n\n22.        In view of the following judicial pronouncements, it is\n\nno longer res integra that <a href=\"/doc/249731/\" id=\"a_45\">Article 137</a> of the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_46\">Limitation Act</a>\n\nsquarely applies in Arbitral Proceedings.\n\n\n23.        Applying the principle laid down in Major (Retd.)\n\nInder Singh Rekhi Vrs.                    Delhi Development Authority:\n\n(1988) 2 SCC 338 that the date relevant for determining the\n\ncause of action would be reckoned such as would fall under <a href=\"/doc/249731/\" id=\"a_47\">Article\n\n137</a> of the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_48\">Limitation Act</a> and not the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_49\">Arbitration\n\nAct</a>, the Apex Court, in somewhat similar circumstances, in Utkal\n\nCommercial Corporation Vrs.                   Central     Coal Fields Ltd.:\n\n(1999) 2 SCC 571 held the proceedings to have been emerged\n\nfrom the date the dispute stood raised by the parties.\n\n\n24.        The principle stands reiterated in Morena Mandal\n\nS.S.K. Ltd. Vrs. New India Assurance Co. Ltd.: (1999) 5 SCC\n\n697; Hari Shankar Singhania and others Vrs. Gaur Hari\n\nSinghania and others: (2006) 4 SCC 658; Punjab State and\n\nOthers Vrs. Dina Nath: (2007) 5 SCC 28; Visakhapatnam\n                             Page - 12 of 20\n\nPort Trust Vrs. Continental Construction Company: (2009)\n\n4 SCC 546.\n\n\n\n25.        In fact in Hari Shankar Singhania(supra) the Apex\n\nCourt categorically held that the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/249731/\" id=\"a_50\">Article 137</a> of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_51\">Limitation Act</a> would apply to the applications under <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 20</a> of\n\nthe Arbitration Act, 1940. We are dealing with the provisions of\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_53\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</a> (for short A.C Act). Even\n\nwith regard to the instant act i.e. A.C. Act, the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/249731/\" id=\"a_54\">Article\n\n137</a> of the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_55\">Limitation Act</a> would be applicable which view stands\n\ntaken by the Apex Court in Visakhapatnam Port Trust(supra).\n\n\n26.        Before proceeding further, it is deemed fit and proper\n\nto refer herein to <a href=\"/doc/54424454/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 43(3)</a> of the AC Act. From a perusal of\n\nthe said statutory provision, it is crystal clear that where an\n\nArbitration Agreement, to submit a future dispute to arbitration\n\nprovides that any claim to which the Agreement applies, shall be\n\nbarred, unless some steps to commence the arbitral proceedings\n\nis taken within the time, fixed by the Agreement.\n\n\n27.        In the instant cases, admittedly by submitting the\n\nLetters dated 19.12.2017 &amp; 04.12.2018 (Annexures-1 &amp; 3 to the\n\nrespective paper books), the petitioner had taken some steps, in\n\nconnection with the arbitration, and therefore, the petitioner\n\ncannot be non-suited, by taking aid of <a href=\"/doc/54424454/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 43(3)</a> of the AC\n\nAct. That apart, the latter part of <a href=\"/doc/54424454/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 43(3)</a> of the AC Act has\n\nclothed the Court with the jurisdiction, to extend the time so fixed,\n\non equitable considerations, namely, undue hardship.\n\n\n28.        What is curious to note herein is that soon after the\n\npromulgation of the <a href=\"/doc/54424454/\" id=\"a_59\">AC Act</a>, including <a href=\"/doc/54424454/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 43(3)</a> of the AC Act,\n                                       Page - 13 of 20\n\non 08.01.1997, Parliament had made a corresponding change of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act, 1872. For determination of the\n\npresent lis, Exception 3 of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act, as has\n\nbeen inserted, by the Amendment, is inconsequential, and hence,\n\nfor ready reference, <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act, as it stood,\n\nprior to amendment and posterior to amendment (with effect from\n\n08.01.1997), without Exception 3 thereof, are put up hereinbelow\n\nin a tabular form:-\n             <a href=\"/doc/88588358/\" id=\"a_64\">Section           28</a>            pre-1997       <a href=\"/doc/88588358/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 28</a> post-1997 amendment\n             amendment\n             28 Agreements in restraint of                  28 Agreements in restraint of\n             legal     proceedings,                void:-   legal proceedings, void:- Every\n             Every agreement, by which any                  agreement,--\n             party     thereto        is     restricted     (a) by which any party thereto is\n             absolutely    from       enforcing       his   restricted absolutely from enforcing\n             rights under or in respect of any              his rights under or in respect of\n             contract,    by    the        usual    legal   any contract, by the usual legal\n             proceedings       in     the     ordinary      proceedings       in    the     ordinary\n             tribunals, or which limits the                 tribunals, or which limits the time\n             time within which he may thus                  within which he may thus enforce\n             enforce his rights, is void to that            his rights; or\n             extent.\n                                                            (b) which extinguishes the rights of\n                                                            any party thereto, or discharges\n                                                            any   party      thereto,     from        any\n                                                            liability, under or in respect of any\n                                                            contract   on     the   expiry       of    a\n                                                            specified period so as to restrict\n             Exception     1.--             Saving      of   any party from enforcing his rights,\n             contract to refer to arbitration               is void to that extent.\n             dispute that may arise --This                   Exception 1.-- Saving of contract\n             section shall not render illegal a             to refer to arbitration dispute that\n             contract, by which two or more                 may arise --This section shall not\n             persons agree that any dispute                 render illegal a contract, by which\n             which may arise between them                   two or more persons agree that\n             in respect of any subject or class             any   dispute     which       may    arise\n             of subjects shall be referred to               between them in respect of any\n             arbitration, and that only the                 subject or class of subjects shall be\n             amount       awarded            in     such    referred to arbitration, and that\n             arbitration shall be recoverable               only the amount awarded in such\n             in respect of the dispute so                   arbitration shall be recoverable in\n                                     Page - 14 of 20\n\n              referred.                               respect of the dispute so referred.\n              Exception      2.--     Saving     of\n              contract to refer questions that        Exception 2.-- Saving of contract\n              have already arisen -- Nor shall         to   refer   questions    that       have\n              this section render illegal any         already arisen -- Nor shall this\n              contract in writing, by which two       section render illegal any contract\n              or more persons agree to refer          in writing, by which two or more\n              to   arbitration     any   question     persons      agree   to      refer     to\n              between them which has already          arbitration any question between\n              arisen, or affect any provision of      them which has already arisen, or\n              any law in force for the time           affect any provision of any law in\n              being   as     to    references   to    force for the time being as to\n              arbitration.                            references to arbitration.\n\n\n\n\n29.        From a bare reading of the above table, it would be\n\namply clear that whereas the substantive part of un-amended\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act mandated that an Agreement, by\n\nwhich any party thereto, is absolutely restricted from enforcing his\n\nrights, under or in respect of any contract, by the usual legal\n\nproceedings, in ordinary Tribunals, or which limits the time, within\n\nwhich he may otherwise enforce his rights, would be void to that\n\nextent. Apart from the said substantive part, there were two\n\nexceptions.\n\n\n30.        However, the substantive part of amended <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 28</a>\n\nof the Contract Act comprises of two components, namely, <a href=\"/doc/62143980/\" id=\"a_68\">Section\n\n28(a)</a> &amp; <a href=\"/doc/112434088/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 28(b)</a>. A contrast of the substantive parts of un-\n\namended &amp; amended <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act reveals that\n\nthe substantive part of un-amended <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act\n\ncorresponds to amended <a href=\"/doc/333029/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 28(a)</a> of the Contract Act, and\n\nthe substantive part of amended <a href=\"/doc/616001/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 28(b)</a> of the Contract Act\n\nis a new inclusion which mandates that every Agreement which\n\nextinguishes the rights of any party thereto, or discharges any\n\nparty thereto, from any liability, under or in respect of any\n\ncontract, on its expiry of the specified period, so as to restrict any\n\nparty, from enforcing his rights, is void to that extent.\n                                 Page - 15 of 20\n\n\n\n31.        A comparison of amended <a href=\"/doc/62143980/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 28(a)</a> &amp; amended\n\n<a href=\"/doc/616001/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 28(b)</a> of the Contract Act, would reveal that whereas\n\nClause(a) protects the rights of the party seeking enforcement,\n\nClause(b) dilutes any negation of enforcement of such rights\n\nunder Clause(a). The import of the amendment of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 28</a> of\n\nthe Contract Act, as obtaining, prior to the amendment and\n\nposterior thereto, has been culled out in the following judicial\n\npronouncements: (i) Food Corporation of India Vrs. New\n\nIndia   Assurance       Co.    Ltd.    and     others        :(1994)       3   SCC\n\n324[Paragraphs- 2, 8, 18 &amp; 19]; (ii) A.V.M. Sales Corporation\n\nVrs. Anuradha Chemicals Private Limited: (2012) 2 SCC\n\n315[Paragraphs- 10, 16 &amp; 17] &amp; (iii) Union of India and\n\nanother Vrs. Indusind Bank Limited and another: (2016) 9\n\nSCC 720.\n\n\n32.        Exceptions (1) &amp; (2) would not have any bearing on to\n\nthe Issues raised herein.\n\n\n33.        At this juncture, though not relevant, it would be\n\nprudent to refer to the amendment carried out on 18.01.2013\n\nwhereby Exception (3) to <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act was also\n\ninserted and the same reads as under:\n\n\n           &quot;[Exception 3.--Saving of a guarantee agreement of\n           a bank or a financial institution.--This section shall\n           not render illegal a contract in writing by which any\n           bank or financial institution stipulate a term in a\n           guarantee or any agreement making a provision for\n           guarantee   for    extinguishment      of   the   rights   or\n           discharge of any party thereto from any liability\n           under or in respect of such guarantee or agreement\n           on the expiry of a specified period which is not less\n           than one year from the date of occurring or non-\n           occurring of a specified event for extinguishment or\n           discharge of such party from the said liability.&quot;\n                               Page - 16 of 20\n\n\n\n          Such amendment would be of no consequence for the\n\nsimple reason that the agreement inter se the parties in relation\n\nto which the arbitral clause stood invoked was executed much\n\nprior to such amendment.\n\n\n34.        Inclusion of <a href=\"/doc/112434088/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 28(b)</a>, by way of an amendment, is\n\na pointer to the conclusion that Parliament intended that in fixing\n\nthe period of limitation, there should not be any uncertainty, and\n\nthe same would be solely governed, by the mandate, contained in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/249731/\" id=\"a_79\">Article 137</a> of the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_80\">Limitation Act</a>, and hence, any artificial\n\ndiminution/reduction     of   the    period     of    limitation,    by   any\n\nAgreement, would be impermissible.\n\n\n35.        Consequent upon the amendment of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_81\">Section 28</a> of the\n\nContract Act, <a href=\"/doc/54424454/\" id=\"a_82\">Section 43(3)</a> of the AC Act has lost its efficacy. In\n\nthis context, reference can be made to the Report of the Law\n\nCommission.\n\n\n36.        Report of the Law Commission (Ninety-seventh report)\n\nin relation to <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_83\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act i.e. 2.3 &amp; 2.5 of the\n\nReport are reproduced hereunder:\n\n          &quot;2.3 Effect of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_84\">section 28</a>.- The effect of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_85\">section 28</a> of\n\n          the Contract Act (so far as relates to the subject-\n\n          matter of this Report) may, on the basis of the case\n\n          law on the subject be stated in the form of two\n\n          propositions, to begin with:-\n\n          (a) The parties to an agreement are not allowed to\n\n          substitute their own periods of limitation in place of\n\n          the period laid in the general law of limitation.\n\n          (b) But the parties to an agreement are allowed to\n\n          substitute their own periods of prescription, that is to\n\n          say, they are free to provide that if a party does not\n\n          sue within a specified period,        then the rights\n\n          accruing under the contract shall be forfeited, or\n                         Page - 17 of 20\n\nextinguished or that a party shall be discharged from\n\nall liability under the contract.(The precise words\n\nused may differ from agreement to agreement, but\n\nin substance their object is usually to forfeit or\n\nextinguish the rights). In other words, a clause\n\nlimiting   the   time     for   enforcing    a   remedy    is\n\nprohibited,   but   a    clause   limiting   the   time   for\n\nenforcing a remedy is prohibited, but a clause\n\nlimiting the duration upto which the rights remain\n\nalive, and extinguishing those rights at the end of\n\nsuch period, is permissible.\n\nWe are concerned with the latter proposition and our\n\nobject will be to examine whether it is sound in\n\njustice and logic and beneficial in practice.\n\n\n2.5 Reasoning.--The reasoning under lying these\n\ndecisions is that <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_86\">section 28</a> is aimed at phohibiting\n\nagreements which could operate only so long as the\n\nrights were in existence. The section is aimed only at\n\n--\n</pre>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1\">(a) covenants not to sue at any time; and\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_2\">(b) covenants not to sue after a limited time.\n\nA condition is a contract providing for a forfeiture of\n\nall benefits unless an action is brought within a\n\nspecified period does not therefore violate the\n\nsection. As per contract itself, the fights that might\n\nhave accrued to the party cease to exist on the\n\nexpiry of the periof provided in the contract. What is\n\nhit by <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_87\">section 28</a> is an agreement relinquishing the\n\nremedy only, by providing that if a suit is to be filed,\n\nthen it should be filed within the specified time limit\n\n(the time limit being shorter than the period of\n\nlimitation provided by the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_88\">Limitation Act</a>).Under such\n\na clause, though the rights accrued continue even\n\nbeyond the time limit and are not extinguished, yet\n\nthere is a limiting of the time to sue as prescribed by\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_89\">Limitation Act</a>. It is such a clause that is\n                               Page - 18 of 20\n\n          regarded as void by reason of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_90\">section 28</a>. But if the\n\n          rights themselves are (under the contractual clause\n\n          as widely worded) extinguished, then there is no\n\n          violation of limitation law. How far this distinction is\n\n          supportable or workable is a matter to which we shall\n\n          presently address ourselves.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_3\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_4\">37.        In any event one find the issue to have been\n\nconclusively settled by the Apex Court in Grasim Industries\n\nLimited Vrs.

In view of what have been submitted vis-à-vis Issue\n\nNo.2 supra, any reduction of the period of limitation, by referring\n\nto any Clause of the Agreement would have the effect of\n\nsupersession of the statutory prescription, contained in <a href=\"/doc/249731/\" id=\"a_97\">Article\n\n137</a>, falling under Part II of the Schedule, appended to the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_98\">Limitation Act, 1963</a>.
