The applicants herein have contended that the\n     order of arrest for vessel - MV FOLK BEAUTY\n     was       obtained            by     opponent          no.1     -     original\n     plaintiff             for     recovery            of   balance        purchase\n     consideration of AED 17,392,801.13 under the\n     sales        contract          dated         17.05.2018        at     Fujairah\n     Court. Before the Temporal Judge of Fujairah\n     Court,         the        learned         Judge        granted       order    of\n     arrest of the said vessel - MT FOLK BEAUTY.\n     However, as the vessel had moved before the\n     order of arrest could be served, opponent no.1\n     filed          another             application            before        Sharjah\n     Federal Court of First Instance and obtained\n     the order of arrest of the vessel - MT FOLK\n     BEAUTY for recovery of the very said amount.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_5\">4.   It is also contended by the applicants that as\n     the       vessel          -    MT      FOLK        BEAUTY      was      heavily\n     mortgaged            and      could        not     satisfy        the     entire\n     claim, opponent no.1 filed an application for\n     arrest         of     the      present            vessel    and      contended\n     that       opponent           no.1       had       a   right     to     proceed\n     against             the   present          vessel       for    recovery       of\n     unpaid         sale        consideration.              Such     application\n     was rejected by an order dated 19.09.2018. It\n     is     further            alleged        that       the    said       order   is\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                        Page 2 of 47</span>\n           C/AS/44/2018                                              IA ORDER\n\n\n\n     purposely                not     produced          along         with          the\n     application              and     it    is       also    alleged        by      the\n     applicants that such material facts have been\n     suppressed. It is contended that having failed\n     once, it is not open for opponent no.1 to once\n     again approach this Court and re­agitate the\n     same       issue.         It    is further             contended          by   the\n     applicants            that      permitting            opponent       no.1       to\n     continue            with       the    present      proceedings             would\n     give a leeway to unscrupulous litigants like\n     it     to      initiate         one      action        after     the       other\n     before          different            Courts       till     a     favourable\n     order is not obtained. It is contended by the\n     applicants               that    such         practice     ought          to    be\n     deprecated and opponent no.1 should be saddled\n     with heavy cost.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">5.   The applicants have also averred that having\n     failed before the Court at Fujairah, opponent\n     no.1 approached this Court and filed Admiralty\n     Suit        no.38        of     2018.      It    is     averred       by       the\n     applicants that the Suit was filed in respect\n     of a sale purchase contract dispute between\n     opponents            no.1        and      2     and     arrest        of       the\n     defendant            -    vessel       was      primarily         sought        on\n     ground that she is sister vessel of MT FOLK\n     BEAUTY owned by opponent no.2 herein and this\n     Court, by an order dated 24.09.2018, arrested\n     the present vessel. It is further alleged by\n     the       applicants            that       opponent        no.1       had       an\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                      Page 3 of 47</span>\n           C/AS/44/2018                                               IA ORDER\n\n\n\n     option         to exercise              its right         to repose             the\n     cargo and sue for damages. However, instead of\n     that, opponent no.1 opted to sue for recovery\n     on       unpaid           sale      consideration               under       sale\n     purchase contract dated 17.05.2018 and thus,\n     having              elected        to       recover            unpaid       sale\n     consideration, opponent no.1 waived its right\n     to     repose         or    resale        the      cargo       and    sue       for\n     damages.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">6.   The applicants have further stated that during\n     pendency             of    Admiralty            Suit     no.38       of    2018,\n     opponent             no.2        secured          complete         claim        of\n     opponent            no.1     before        the     Fujairah          Court       by\n     providing bank guarantee dated 21.10.2018 of\n     AED 17,392,801.13. On that basis, the Court at\n     Fujairah released the present vessel from its\n     order          of         arrest      and         attached         the      bank\n     guarantee by an order dated 20.10.2018. The\n     applicants                thereafter            filed    an     application\n     being O.J. Civil Application no.2 of 2018 in\n     Admiralty Suit no.38 of 2018 seeking release\n     of the present vessel and by an order dated\n     25.10.2018,               this     Court        permitted        release        of\n     the present vessel considering the fact that\n     complete claim made by opponent no.1 herein\n     was secured before the Court at Fujairah. It\n     is further contended by the applicants that on\n     the      same        day,     the     present           Suit    came       to    be\n     filed before this Court on the basis of the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                      Page 4 of 47</span>\n   C/AS/44/2018                                              IA ORDER\n\n\n\naverments made in the plaint which is filed\nfor claiming loss of profit suffered by the\nopponent          no.1        as        seller        and       cost     of\narbitration. It is further contended that such\nclaim was never made and it is made for the\nfirst time before this Court in the present\nSuit.       It         is    further            alleged        that     the\napplicants had consciously relinquished and/or\nabandoned         its       claim     for loss          of profit       and\ncost of arbitration and opponent no.1, having\nomitted, cannot be permitted to file the Suit\nclaiming such reliefs. It is contended that\nhaving           chosen        to        recover         unpaid        sale\nconsideration               under        sales        contract         dated\n17.05.2018         and       having           secured    the     complete\nsale      consideration                before         the      Court      at\nFujairah, opponent no.1 cannot be permitted to\nclaim for loss of profit that it could have\nmade by selling the cargo in open market. It\nis also alleged that having chosen to file a\nsubstantial Suit for recovery of unpaid sale\nconsideration,               the         plaintiff          cannot       be\npermitted to invoke arbitration clause under\nthe sales purchase contract and recover loss\nof profit. On the aforesaid factual basis, the\napplicants have prayed that the application be\nallowed          and    this       Court        may   be     pleased     to\nrelease the defendant-vessel - MT QUEEN HELENA\nfrom     the      order       of      arrest      dated       25.10.2018\npassed in the present Suit.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                               Page 5 of 47</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">           C/AS/44/2018                                           IA ORDER\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">7.   In response to the service of copy of this\n     application, opponent no.1-original plaintiff\n     has       filed        an     affidavit­in­reply.                 Opponent\n     no.1-original                plaintiff              has    denied            the\n     contentions raised in the application. It is\n     mainly contended that the applicants have made\n     out no case for setting aside the arrest order\n     and that the plaintiff has strong prima facie\n     case       which       would    be defeated               if the       arrest\n     order is vacated. It is also contended that\n     the application is not maintainable as it is\n     completely            misconceived.            It    is    also    alleged\n     that the application is ex­facie contrary to\n     the catena of judgments of this Court and the\n     applicable international conventions and it is\n     also alleged that the applicants are trying to\n     mislead this Court. It is also contended by\n     opponent no.1 that all the issues raised on\n     behalf of the applicants would require finding\n     of fact and law and would necessitate full­\n     fledged trial and therefore, it would not be\n     in the interest of justice for this Court to\n     set aside the order of arrest dated 25.10.2018\n     at       an         interlocutory             stage.      It      is        also\n     contended that the application raises triable\n     issues,             which     cannot           be     decided          at    an\n     interlocutory               stage      and      therefore,         make       a\n     strong case for which the present suit to be\n     tried at an early date. The factual averments\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                    Page 6 of 47</span>\n        C/AS/44/2018                                             IA ORDER\n\n\n\n     made in the application are denied in toto by\n     opponent         no.1.    It       is,        therefore,        contended\n     that the application deserves to be dismissed.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">8.   The applicants have also filed an affidavit\n     and have produced the alleged claim statement\n     dated 10.10.2018 filed by opponent no.1 herein\n     before the Arbitral Tribunal, which is in form\n     of a request for arbitration.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">9.   Mr. Unmesh D. Shukla, learned counsel for the\n     applicants has contended that the present Suit\n     is barred as provided under <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_1\">Order II Rule 2 of\n     the    Code      of     Civil       Procedure</a>,           1908.     It    was\n     contended         that    having              elected      to     sue    for\n     price, the plaintiff cannot be permitted to\n     sue    for       loss    of      profit.           It   was     therefore\n     contended         that        the            plaintiff         cannot     be\n     permitted to approbate and reprobate. It was\n     also contended that the plaintiff cannot be\n     permitted to take mutually destructive pleas\n     and     had       only    two          options.           After       having\n     affirmed         the    contract             and   sued    for     balance\n     sale      consideration,                the        plaintiff          cannot\n     repudiate        the     contract            and sue       for loss       of\n     profit. It was further contended that the loss\n     of profit is a claim for unliquidated damages\n     and cannot be secured by way of arrest of a\n     vessel      or    otherwise.            It     was      also    contended\n     that      the      Suit        to       secure          claim      pending\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                   Page 7 of 47</span>\n         C/AS/44/2018                                          IA ORDER\n\n\n\n    arbitration           is     not       maintainable       as    per    the\n    provisions           of    the     Admiralty          Act,     2017.       On\n    facts,        it     was     further          contended       that    even\n    though         the       claim     statement           was     submitted\n    before the Arbitral Tribunal on 10.10.2018, no\n    amendment was carried out in Admiralty Suit\n    no.38 of 2018. It was also contended that in\n    fact, the Fujairah Court had already rejected\n    a   similar          claim       and    therefore,        the      present\n    Suit is not maintainable.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">10. Mr. Shukla further submitted that there is an\n    absolute           prohibition          for    filing     the      present\n    Suit as provided under <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_2\">Order II Rule 2 of the\n    Code      of Civil         Procedure</a>,          1908.     It was also\n    contended           that     the       present      claim     is     not   a\n    maritime claim as defined under Section 4 of\n    the Admiralty Act, 2017. It was contended that\n    the opponent no.1-original plaintiff does not\n    require any protection pending the arbitration\n    and having sued for price and having elected\n    to affirm the contract, opponent no.1-original\n    plaintiff cannot be allowed to approbate and\n    reprobate           as     the     reliefs          claimed     for    are\n    mutually destructive and cannot be claimed. It\n    was      further          contended          that     therefore,       the\n    legal position would be that when a contract\n    is broken, the party is not bound to accept\n    the breach and either of the two remedies are\n    available;           firstly,          to     accept    and     sue    for\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                  Page 8 of 47</span>\n      C/AS/44/2018                                             IA ORDER\n\n\n\nremedy; or can insist for performance of the\ncontract. It was submitted that the plaintiff,\nby their conduct, has affirmed the contract\nand having affirmed the contract, they are not\nentitled to pursue the goods in hands of the\nbuyer. Referring to the relevant provisions of\n<a href=\"/doc/651105/\" id=\"a_3\">Sales of Goods Act</a>, it was contended by the\nlearned counsel for the applicants that two\nremedies            are    envisaged            under    the     said     Act;\none,        being         real      remedy;        and        other      being\npersonal remedy. It was contended that once\ndelivery            is    given,       real      remedies        are     lost.\nReferring to <a href=\"/doc/1569181/\" id=\"a_4\">Sections 45</a>, <a href=\"/doc/392156/\" id=\"a_5\">46</a>, <a href=\"/doc/829056/\" id=\"a_6\">53</a>, <a href=\"/doc/298488/\" id=\"a_7\">54</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1971471/\" id=\"a_8\">55</a> of\nthe Sales of Goods Act, the learned counsel\nalso contended that what are the rights of an\nunpaid         seller       are       provided          under     the     said\nprovisions. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"508918\" id=\"span_9\">However, right to recall the goods\nis     not provided              and it         was reiterated           that\nonce the delivery is given, real remedies are\nlost       and      right       to pursue         goods       stands     lost\nonce the delivery is given and hence, claim\nraised in the Suit is not available under the\n<a href=\"/doc/651105/\" id=\"a_9\">Sales of Goods Act</a>.

It was further\ncontended that as per the memo of sale, goods\nwere to be sent to Yemen, for which, opponent\nno.1 - original plaintiff could have hired any\nvessel for transporting the goods from Hamriya\nto Yemen.

Relying upon the judgment of the\nHon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1662395/\" id=\"a_23\">Deva Ram &amp;\nAnr. v.

It was contended\nthat first Suit being Admiralty Suit no.38 of\n2018     was       filed       as       the      cargo     belonging        to\nopponent          no.1         -        original         plaintiff          was\nwrongfully             misappropriated                and        discharged\nwithout          obtaining         requisite          permission           from\nthe plaintiff which was one of the mandatory\ncondition         in     the       charterparty            agreement.       It\nwas also contended that even though opponent\nno.1 - original plaintiff, being the charterer\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                               Page 16 of 47</span>\n      C/AS/44/2018                                                  IA ORDER\n\n\n\nof the vessel, the cargo was dealt with by\ndefendants                no.2        and          3        in     breach        of\ncharterparty.               Mr. Soparkar                further        contended\nthat second Suit being Admiralty Suit no.44 of\n2018       has       been initiated                to       secure      claim    in\narbitration which covers the losses suffered\ndue to fluctuation in the cargo under the sale\ncontract            and     the      said         Suit      is     filed      after\nopponent            no.1    invoked           arbitration              and    filed\nthe request for arbitration for appointment of\nthe arbitrator. It was also contended that as\nit     is      evident       from         the      plaint          itself,      the\nsecond Suit has been filed for loss of profit\nunder          the        sale        contract              to     secure       the\nplaintiff&#x27;s claim in a pending arbitration. It\nwas       therefore          contended             that          the   cause     of\naction         in     both       the      Suits         are       separate      and\ndistinct.            It     was        also        contended           that     the\ndefendant - vessel has already been released\nin the first Suit and therefore, there is no\nmultiplicity of the proceedings as alleged by\nthe applicants. It was also contended that the\ncontention of the applicants that the earlier\nSuit could have been amended to include the\npresent claim is wrong as both the Suits are\npremised            on     separate          causes          of     action      and\nthus,        it      was     contended             that          the   cause     of\naction         in both        the Suits                are       different      and\ndistinct. It was contended that only because\nin      the         first    Suit,          it         is    mentioned        that\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                  Page 17 of 47</span>\n   C/AS/44/2018                                              IA ORDER\n\n\n\nopponent no.1 - original plaintiff seeks leave\nof this Court to add or amend the plaint as\nthe same was filed in great urgency, would not\ngive    any        right    to     the       plaintiff         to      join    a\nseparate cause of action and the first Suit\ncould not have been amended and the plaintiff\nwas required to file a separate Suit.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1662395\" id=\"span_30\">Relying\nupon the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in\nthe case of <a href=\"/doc/1662395/\" id=\"a_27\">Deva Ram &amp; Anr.</a> (supra), it was\ncontended that even though the present Suit is\nbetween          the     same     parties        as      the    cause         of\naction        is        different,       first        Suit      based         on\ncharterparty agreement and second Suit under\nthe    sales        contract       agreement,            the    same       are\nmaintainable.

Relying upon the averments made\nin Paragraphs 4 and 5 of the plaint, it was\ncontended that the ownership of the defendant-\nvessel was changed fraudulently to defeat the\nclaim         of      the        plaintiff             and    it    was      also\ncontended             that       the       plaintiff          has     produced\nenough evidence to establish that the vessels-\nMT FOLK BEAUTY and MT QUEEN HELENA are sister\nvessels.             It   was        contended           that       though    an\nattempt             has   been       made         to    canvass      that    the\nvessel - MT FOLK BEAUTY and MT QUEEN HELENA\nare not sister vessels and that the ownership\nof the defendant - vessel had changed before\nthe arrest, the applicants have not produced\nany document to establish change in ownership\nof      the         vessel       and     even          the   memorandum       of\nagreement by which both the defendants agreed\nto sale the defendant - vessel have not been\nproduced. It was also contended that even the\nbill of sale which is issued at the time of\nsale of vessel or protocol of delivery issued\nat the time when the vessel is handed over to\ndefendant no.3 has not been produced. It was\nalso contended that as such no sale has taken\nplace and therefore, it was asserted that the\ndefendant - vessel is the sister vessel of MT\nFOLK       BEAUTY.

Mr.        Soparkar          further              contended          that       the\n    conduct of the defendants no.2 and 3 clearly\n    shows that they are related Companies having\n    commonality                 of         interest,                control         and\n    operation.            It    was        contended             that    they      have\n    acted         in      breach          of      the       charterparty           and\n    discharged            cargo         without            authorization           from\n    the plaintiff. Similarly, defendant no.2 did\n    not make payment under sale contract pricing\n    of      which         was        agreed           as      per       the      Platts\n    quotations. It was also contended that email\n    correspondence               clearly              shows      that     defendant\n    no.2        did      not     hand        over          the    cargo       to   the\n    plaintiff neither did they allow the plaintiff\n    to      board        the     vessel           when        they       repeatedly\n    requested and even the inspection team was not\n    permitted            to    board        the vessel.

Thus, both the Suits\n    relate to one commodity as a whole i.e. sale\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                Page 32 of 47</span>\n      C/AS/44/2018                                                     IA ORDER\n\n\n\nof      gas         oil     by         opponent            no.1       -     original\nplaintiff.

It is a matter of fact that the plaintiff was\n    informed that the cargo has been discharged\n    without production of bill of lading and in\n    breach of the terms of the charterparty and\n    even         though             the    attempts           were        made     to\n    repossess the cargo, opponent no.2 - original\n    defendant                no.2    did     not       allow    the       original\n    plaintiff to even board the vessel - MT FOLK\n    BEAUTY         and        it    is    in     this     context         that    the\n    cause of action has arisen in Admiralty Suit\n    no.      38         of    2018,       which       directly       relates       to\n    breach of Clauses 8 and 10 of the charterparty\n    agreement.               The     present          applicants         have    been\n    made        defendants            in       the     Suit    as     they       have\n    common          interest.             Therefore,          the     contention\n    that mutually destructive pleas are taken in\n    both the Suits, is not correct. Similarly, the\n    contention as regards the sale of goods also\n    deserves to be negatived as it is an admitted\n    position that the sale price is not completely\n    paid          and         even        though         the        charterparty\n    agreement clearly provides that the goods were\n    to be discharged and delivery was to be given\n    with written permission of the charterer and\n    only on receipt of full balance of payment due\n    to      opponent           no.1,        the       seller,       as    per    the\n    commercial               invoice        without       there       being       any\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                                      Page 37 of 47</span>\n      C/AS/44/2018                                           IA ORDER\n\n\n\nwritten permission or without payment of the\nbalance amount of sale consideration and even\nin     absence       of original             bill       of lading,       the\ncargo        was     discharged         without          production       of\nbill of lading which is in breach of terms of\nthe       charterparty.          Thus,        the       first     Suit   is\nbased on the alleged misappropriation of cargo\nunder the charterparty and the second Suit is\nfor loss of profit for non­return of the goods\nwhich         were    delivered          by       the      charterer      in\nbreach of the conditions of the charterparty.\nOnly because the parties are same, it cannot\nbe said that mutually destructive pleas are\ntaken and therefore, the principles of <a href=\"/doc/651105/\" id=\"a_53\">Sales\nof Goods Act</a> are not attracted at all as the\ntitle has not passed because of non­payment of\nfull        sale     price.

A right in rem is a valuable\n   right that a party has for the\n   purpose of obtaining security in\n   respect of a maritime claim.
