Clause 2.5 requires the\n                                      employer, i.e. Respondent No. 1 to raise a claim if the employer\n                                      considered himself entitled to any payment under any Clause,\n                                      in connection with the Contract. The Engineer was, thereafter,\n                                      required to proceed in accordance with Clause 3.5, to determine\n                                      the amount, if any, to which the employer was entitled to be\n                                      paid by the contractor. As such, Respondent No. 1 was not\n                                      entitled to any amount, till there was an a priori determination,\n                                      by the Engineer, of such entitlement, under Clause 3.5. Any\n                                      such determination was also subject to revision by the DAB\n                                      and, thereafter, by the Arbitral Tribunal. In the present case,\n                                      they had been no determination of liability, by the Engineer,\n                                      under Clause 3.5.       Respondent No. 1 could not, therefore,\n                                      proceed to encash the Bank Guarantees, by resorting to Clauses\n                                      15.3 and 15.4. This itself made out a case for injunctive relief,\n                                      in favour of the petitioner, till the matter was decided in arbitral\n                                      proceedings.

Nor could it be stated that\n                                    irreparable injustice will ensue, were the bank guarantees\n                                    encashed, as Respondent No. 1 was a reputed Public Sector\n                                    Undertaking.         Bank guarantees were separate contracts, and\n                                    were not dispute-centric. The right to invoke Bank Guarantees\n                                    was independent of the dispute between the parties. Banks are\n                                    bound to honour bank guarantees, irrespective of the disputes\n                                    between the parties.

In fact, the said reliance was\n                                    self-defeating, as Itek Corpn9 involved a situation of\n                                    impossibility, to enforce a decree, passed by American Courts,\n                                    in Iran. In the present case, the petitioner was engaged in\n                                    litigation in India, and could not allege, therefore, that it could\n                                    not execute the award, were it to result in favour of the\n                                    petitioner, in India. Rather, Respondent No. 1 would find itself\n                                    unable to execute any award, passed in its favour, in a foreign\n                                    country. Itek Corpn9, therefore, advanced the case of\n                                    Respondent No. 1, rather than that of the petitioner.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1028714\" id=\"span_192\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"854142\" id=\"span_193\">On the\n                                    principle that courts should be slow in staying the invocation of\n                                    bank guarantees, the learned Solicitor General placed reliance\n                                    on <a href=\"/doc/854142/\" id=\"a_11\">Himadri Chemicals Industries Ltd v.

The law relating to invocation of bank guarantees is by\n                                       now well settled by a catena of decisions of this Court. The\n                                       bank guarantees which provided that they are payable by the\n                                       guarantor on demand is considered to be an unconditional\n                                       bank guarantee. When in the course of commercial dealings,\n                                       unconditional guarantees have been given or accepted the\n                                       beneficiary is entitled to realise such a bank guarantee in\n                                       terms thereof irrespective of any pending disputes. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1746106\" id=\"span_235\">In <a href=\"/doc/1746106/\" id=\"a_42\">U.P.\n                                       State Sugar Corpn. v.

The law relating to invocation of such bank\n                                               guarantees is by now well settled. When in the course\n                                               of commercial dealings an unconditional bank\n                                               guarantee is given or accepted, the beneficiary is\n                                               entitled to realise such a bank guarantee in terms\n                                               thereof irrespective of any pending disputes. The bank\n                                               giving such a guarantee is bound to honour it as per its\n                                               terms irrespective of any dispute raised by its\n                                               customer. The very purpose of giving such a bank\n                                               guarantee would otherwise be defeated. The courts\n                                               should, therefore, be slow in granting an injunction to\n                                               restrain the realisation of such a bank guarantee. The\n                                               courts have carved out only two exceptions. A fraud in\n                                               connection with such a bank guarantee would vitiate\n                                               the very foundation of such a bank guarantee. Hence if\n                                               there is such a fraud of which the beneficiary seeks to\n                                               take advantage, he can be restrained from doing so.\n                                               The second exception relates to cases where allowing\n                                               the encashment of an unconditional bank guarantee\n                                               would result in irretrievable harm or injustice to one of\n                                               the parties concerned. Since in most cases payment of\n                                               money under such a bank guarantee would adversely\n                                               affect the bank and its customer at whose instance the\n                                               guarantee is given, the harm or injustice contemplated\n                                               under this head must be of such an exceptional and\n                                               irretrievable nature as would override the terms of the\n\n                            24(2007)   6 SCC 470\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_236\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_237\">Digitally Signed By:SUNIL</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_238\">SINGH NEGI                  O.M.P.

The bank is always obliged to honour its guarantee as\n                                   long as it is an unconditional and irrevocable one. The dispute\n                                   between the beneficiary and the party at whose instance the\n                                   bank has given the guarantee is immaterial and of no\n                                   consequence. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1342691\" id=\"span_241\">In <a href=\"/doc/1342691/\" id=\"a_43\">BSES Ltd. v.

The condition that the amounts shall be paid\n                                       only upon establishing the supplier to be in default for the\n                                       performance of their warranty obligation under the contract\n                                       has been specifically deleted.

These paras illustrate, lucidly, the distinction between a\n                            conditional bank guarantee and an unconditional bank guarantee. The\n                            judgement in Vinitec Electronics12 makes it abundantly clear that the\n                            first aspect, to be taken into consideration, is the bank guarantee itself,\n                            and the terms thereof. If the bank guarantee is conditional, then, if the\n                            conditions have not been fulfilled, injunction, against encashment and\n                            invocation, may unquestionably follow.               If, however, the bank\n                            guarantee is unconditional, then injunction can be granted only if\n                            egregious fraud, irretrievable injustice, or special equities, exist, and\n                            not otherwise.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_114\">                            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"72238050\" id=\"span_269\">28.

Significantly, Fenner India Ltd23 regards &quot;irretrievable\n                            injustice&quot; as a specie of the &quot;special equities&quot; genus, whereas\n                            Standard Chartered Bank25 treat &quot;special equities&quot; and &quot;irretrievable\n                            26(1996) 5 SCC 450\n                            27(1999) 8 SCC 436\n                            28(2006) 6 SCC 293\n                            29(2016) 10 SCC 46\n                            302012 (2) SCALE 58: JT 2012 (2) SC 17\n                            31(2016) 14 SCC 517\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_279\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_280\">Digitally Signed By:SUNIL</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_281\">SINGH NEGI                  O.M.P.

In\n                            the case of the Advance Bank Guarantees, the statement, to be\n                            presented by Respondent No. 1, is required to state that the petitioner\n                            has used the Advance Payment for purposes other than the costs of\n                            mobilization in respect of the works, or has failed to repay the\n                            Advance Payment in accordance with the contract conditions,\n                            specifying the amount which the petitioner has failed to repay. The\n                            Performance Bank Guarantee, on the other hand, requires Respondent\n                            No. 1 to furnish a statement, stating that the petitioner is in breach of\n                            its obligations under the contract. The Performance Bank Guarantee\n                            makes the matter even more explicit, by stipulating that Respondent\n                            No. 1 is not required to prove or show grounds, justifying the said\n                            statement. Though such a caveat is not to be found in the covenants of\n                            the Advance Bank Guarantees, the mere fact that they only required\n                            the furnishing of a statement, by Respondent No. 1, and nothing more,\n                            incorporates, by implication, such a covenant. In other words, be it\n                            the Advance Bank Guarantees or the Performance Bank Guarantee, if\n                            Respondent No. 1 furnishes a statement, to the effect as stipulated in\n                            the Bank Guarantee(s), the Bank is bound to honour the Bank\n                            Guarantee, and Respondent No. 1 is entitled to invoke and encash it.\n                            There is no material to indicate that Respondent No. 1 has furnished,\n                            to the concerned Bank(s), statements, as required by the Bank\n                            Guarantees, towards invocation thereof.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_304\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_305\">Digitally Signed By:SUNIL</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_306\">SINGH NEGI                  O.M.P.

In other words, in the\n                            case of the Performance Bank Guarantee, for example, if Respondent\n                            No. 1 were to furnish a statement, to the Bank <a href=\"/doc/156037084/\" id=\"a_53\">- <a href=\"/doc/156037084/\" id=\"a_54\">in that case</a></a>, the\n                            Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd. - that the petitioner is\n                            in breach of its obligations under the contract, the Bank would, ipso\n                            facto, be obligated to honour the Bank Guarantee, and Respondent\n                            No. 1 would be entitled to invoke it. It would not be open to the\n                            petitioner to come to the Court, questioning the correctness of the\n                            statement furnished by Respondent No. 1 to the Bank, by contending\n                            that it had not, in fact, breached its obligations under the contract, for\n                            the simple reason that the dispute between the petitioner and\n                            Respondent No. 1 is entirely foreign to the bank guarantee, and to the\n                            obligations of the Bank under the bank guarantee, which requires only\n                            furnishing of a statement by Respondent No. 1, and nothing more.\n                            The bank guarantee constitutes an independent contract between the\n                            Bank and Respondent No. 1, which has to abide by the covenants of\n                            that contract.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_129\">                            40.

A benefit or advantage to the deceiver,\n                                       will almost always call loss or detriment to the deceived.\n                                       Even in those rare cases where there is a benefit or advantage\n                                       to the deceiver, but no corresponding loss to the deceived, the\n                                       second condition is satisfied.

Fraud is a conduct\n                                   either by letter or words, which includes the other person or\n                                   authority to take a definite determinative stand as a response\n                                   to the conduct of the former either by words or letter. It is\n                                   also well settled that misrepresentation itself amounts to\n                                   fraud. Indeed, innocent misrepresentation may also give\n                                   reason to claim relief against fraud. A fraudulent\n                                   misrepresentation is called deceit and consists in leading a\n                                   man into damage by willfully or recklessly causing him to\n                                   believe and act on falsehood. It is a fraud in law if a party\n                                   makes representations, which he knows to be false, and injury\n                                   ensues therefrom although the motive from which the\n                                   representations proceeded may not have been bad. An act of\n                                   fraud on court is always viewed seriously. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"371933\" id=\"span_327\">A collusion or\n                                   conspiracy with a view to deprive the rights of the others in\n                                   relation to a property would render the transaction void ab\n                                   initio. Fraud and deception are synonymous. Although in a\n                                   given case a deception may not amount to fraud, fraud is\n                                   anathema to all equitable principles and any affair tainted\n                                   with fraud cannot be perpetuated or saved by the application\n                                   of any equitable doctrine including res judicata.

According to\n                                   Halsbury&#x27;s Laws of England, a representation is deemed to\n                                   have been false, and therefore a misrepresentation, if it was at\n                                   the material date false in substance and in fact. <a href=\"/doc/299780/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 17</a> of\n                                   the Indian Contract Act, 1872 defines &quot;fraud&quot; as act\n                                   committed by a party to a contract with intent to deceive\n                                   another. From dictionary meaning or even otherwise fraud\n                                   arises out of deliberate active role of representator about a\n                                   fact, which he knows to be untrue yet he succeeds in\n                                   misleading the representee by making him believe it to be\n                                   true. The representation to become fraudulent must be of fact\n                                   with knowledge that it was false. In a leading English case i.e.\n                                   Derry and Ors. v. Peek (1886-90) All ER 1 what constitutes\n                                   &quot;fraud&quot; was described thus: (All ER p. 22 B-C) &quot;fraud&quot; is\n                                   proved when it is shown that a false representation has been\n                                   made (i) knowingly, or (ii) without belief in its truth, or (iii)\n                                   recklessly, careless whether it be true or false&quot;. But &quot;fraud&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_134\">                                   in public law is not the same as &quot;fraud&quot; in private law. Nor\n                                   can the ingredients, which establish &quot;fraud&quot; in commercial\n                                   transaction, be of assistance in determining fraud in\n                                   Administrative Law.

Secretary. of State for Home Deptt.\n                                   (1983) 1 All ER 765, that it is dangerous to introduce maxims\n                                   of common law as to effect of fraud while determining fraud\n                                   in relation of statutory law. &quot;Fraud&quot; in relation to statute\n                                   must be a colourable transaction to evade the provisions of a\n                                   statute. &quot;If a statute has been passed for some one particular\n                                   purpose, a court of law will not countenance any attempt\n                                   which may be made to extend the operation of the Act to\n                                   something else which is quite foreign to its object and beyond\n                                   its scope. Present day concept of fraud on statute has veered\n                                   round abuse of power or mala fide exercise of power. It may\n                                   arise due to overstepping the limits of power or defeating the\n                                   provision of statute by adopting subterfuge or the power may\n                                   be exercised for extraneous or irrelevant considerations.

It arises from a\n                                   deception committed by disclosure of incorrect facts\n                                   knowingly and deliberately to invoke exercise of power and\n                                   procure an order from an authority or tribunal.

The\n                            contention, in my view, is wholly without merit.           Itek Corpn9\n                            involved a situation in which an exporter, in USA, entered into an\n                            agreement with the Government of Iran. Certain letters of credit,\n                            issued by an American Bank, in favour of an Iranian Bank, constituted\n                            part of the contract. The USA exporter sought an order terminating its\n                            liability, consequent on the said letters of credit. This, in turn, was\n                            sought as, consequent on hostilities between the US and the Iraqi\n                            government, all Iranian assets, within the jurisdiction of the US, were\n                            blocked by the US government, which also cancelled the export\n                            contract. In these circumstances the Court upheld the contention of\n                            the US exporter that any claim for damages, against the Iranian\n                            purchaser, even if decreed by the Courts in the US, would not be\n                            executable in Iran. In these circumstances, as realisation of the letters\n                            of credit would result in irreparable harm to the American plaintiff,\n                            relief as sought, was granted.      There is no parallel, whatsoever,\n                            between that case and this. Here, if the plaintiff is to succeed in\n                            arbitration, there is no reason why it would not be able to enforce the\n                            award against Respondent No. 1 - which, as the learned Solicitor\n                            General correctly submits, is a reputed Indian Company - in India.\n                            The two cases are as alike as chalk and cheese.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_139\">                            48.

There is\n                            no other ground, on which the existence of &quot;special equities&quot; has been\n                            pleaded.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_141\">                            50.

Needless to say, the learned Solicitor\n                            General placed reliance on <a href=\"/doc/1889495/\" id=\"a_75\">the said decision</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_145\">                            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1889495\" id=\"span_382\">54.

A careful reading of <a href=\"/doc/1889495/\" id=\"a_76\">the said decision</a>\n                            reveals that the learned Single Judge has<a href=\"/doc/1889495/\" id=\"a_77\">, <a href=\"/doc/1889495/\" id=\"a_78\">in that case</a></a>, even while\n                            acknowledging the fact that bank guarantees constitute independent\n                            contracts, as well as the judicial interdictions against stay of\n                            invocation of bank guarantees, granted relief on the ground that the\n                            covenants, of the contract between the parties, did not permit the\n                            respondents to invoke the bank guarantees at that stage.

There is yet another reason, pertinently highlighted by the\n                            learned Solicitor General, why, even on facts, the decision in Larsen\n                            &amp; Toubro Ltd1 cannot come to the aid of the petitioner. The notice of\n                            termination, dated 3rd July, 2020, was issued in exercise of the power\n                            conferred by Sub-Clause 15.2(a) of the Contract. This sub-clause\n                            entitled Respondent No. 1 to terminate the contract in the event of\n                            failure, on the part of the petitioner, to comply with a Notice to\n                            Correct, issued under Sub-Clause 15.1. There is no dispute about the\n                            fact that, in the present case, as many as ten such Notices to Correct\n                            were issued, by Respondent No. 1 to the petitioner. In Larsen &amp;\n                            Toubro Ltd1, per contra, it is specifically found that &quot;for the first\n                            time, the defects in the work have been alleged by the Respondent No.\n                            1 only by its letter dated 28.06.2019, that is, after the invocation of the\n                            Bank Guarantees&quot;. The learned Single Judge also goes on to observe\n                            that Respondent No. 1 (in the said case) had &quot;not been able to refute\n                            the said submission of the petitioner&quot;. In these circumstances, it was\n                            held that, at least prima facie, the stage of invoking Sub-Clause 4.2(d)\n                            of the Contract, had not arisen, on the date of invocation of the Bank\n                            Guarantees.    Even on facts, therefore, Larsen &amp; Toubro Ltd1 is\n                            distinguishable.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_399\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_400\">Digitally Signed By:SUNIL</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_401\">SINGH NEGI                  O.M.P.

Before parting with this judgement, I deem it appropriate to\n                            reiterate the fact that, unlike the situation which existed in Larsen &amp;\n                            Toubro Ltd1, in which steps towards invocation of the bank\n                            guarantees had already been taken by the respondent in that case, the\n                            petitioner has chosen to approach this Court against the 14 day notice\n                            of termination of the contract, issued under Sub-Clause 15.2(a)\n                            thereof. Neither was the contract terminated, nor was any step taken\n                            towards invocation of the Bank Guarantees, at the time when the\n                            present petition was filed before this Court. There is no prayer, to\n                            restrain Respondent No. 1 from terminating the contract. There is no\n                            prayer, seeking an injunction against Respondent No. 1 from acting on\n                            the impugned letter dated 3rd July, 2020. What is sought, directly, is\n                            a restraint, against Respondent No. 1, from invoking/encashing the\n                            bank guarantees furnished by the petitioner, and to restrain the banks\n                            from releasing any payment to the respondent (wrongly referred to, in\n                            prayer (b) in the petition, as &quot;the petitioner&quot;), against such bank\n                            guarantees.    The only additional prayer is for a restraint, against\n                            Respondent No. 1 from making any statement, to any third party, to\n                            the effect that the petitioner had delayed the works or had been unable\n                            to complete the works in time. Quite obviously, this additional prayer\n                            cannot be granted in a proceeding under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 9</a> of the 1996 Act. In\n                            essence, therefore, the petition is premature. I have, nevertheless,\n                            proceeded on merits, with the issue of whether Respondent No. 1 had\n                            the right to invoke, and encash, the bank guarantees furnished by the\n                            petitioner only because the submissions, advanced before me, make it\n                            clear that such invocation and encashment is the inevitable sequitur to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_417\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_418\">Digitally Signed By:SUNIL</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_419\">SINGH NEGI                  O.M.P.
